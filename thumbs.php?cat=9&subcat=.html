<div id="page"><p><p>I graduated in Photography from UCE Birmingham (now Birmingham City University) in 2000. Since 2001 I have been teaching photography for Oxfordshire County Council (adult education). In this time I have worked as a professional photographer specialising in child and family portraits, while at the same time developing my personal interests in other areas of photography. Principal among these is fine art photography of flowers, fruit and vegetables, which complements my interest in gardening and allotments.</p>
<p>I have exhibited seven times in <a href="http://www.artweeks.org">Oxfordshire Artweeks</a>, concentrating on botanical and still life subjects. I also enjoy community photography and have done assignments for such organisations as East Oxford Action and Ithaca. My degree show exhibition of black professionals has been shown in Oxford, Gloucester, Woodstock, Cowley, Leamington Spa and Derby. My most recent exhibition was at the Churchill hospital, Oxford, entitled &quot;Treasures of Oxford Botanic Garden&quot;. Running from April to July 2014,it consisted of 24 large prints of beautiful plants which I photographed at Oxford Botanic Garden over the last few years. Some of the framed pictures are still for sale (see subsection on website).</p>
<p>In 2010 my husband and I bought a beautiful 18th century old mill house in the Isle of Wight, set in two and a half acres of land, with a stream running through. My intention is to run residential photographic courses from the house, which sleeps up to 12 over two buildings. I have also created a beautiful white studio for portraiture. The island is a perfect location for photographers, boasting stunning landscapes; the longest hours of sunshine in the UK and a zoo which specialises in tigers! In addition, you can visit Dimbola Lodge <a href="http://www.dimbola.com">www.dimbola.co.uk</a>, the former home of Julia Margaret Cameron, the eminent Victorian photographer. Located in the west of the island, it is now run as a photographic gallery and museum. There are always good contemporary photographic exhibitions there, as well as the classic collected work of JM Cameron. Go to the Courses page of my website for further information.</p></p></div>   <div id="images">
