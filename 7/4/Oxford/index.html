<div id="page"><p>Since 2001 I have been teaching adult education classes for  Oxfordshire County Council in SLR photography. In June 2015 the service was taken over by Abingdon and Witney College, but they are keeping it very much as it was. Each academic year, starting in September, I run a number classes at different levels. Currently, all  classes are held at Gosford Hill School, Kidlington, in the Adult  Education building, apart from Photoshop courses which are held at the main Abingdon campus.</p>
<p>DSLR Photography classes are labelled Levels 1-6. This effectively means that Level 1 is for complete beginners, but that if you have learnt the basics of how to use your DSLR on manual settings, you can join at any other level, depending on what you want to learn.&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Level 2 is an extension of Level 1, exploring a variety of genres of photography, to find out which settings and camera equipment are appropriate for each one.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level 3 is a Practical summer course, in which we visit a different venue on all but the first and last weeks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Levels 4&amp;5 are what used to be called &quot;Improvers&quot;. At these levels, you will be looking at the work of well known photographers practising in a range of genres, and taking aspects of their work to learn from and adapt. You will also learn about photographic lighting, including flash. There is more of an emphasis on style at this level, and projects run over a longer period.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level 6 is another summer course where we visit different venues each week, or sometimes may be an exhibition class.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>CLASSES FOR JANUARY 2017<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level 2 Tuesday evening (FULL)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level 2 Friday morning (FULL)<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level 4: Thursday morning</strong><strong> (Kidlington) </strong></p>
<p><strong>CLASS BEGINNING 23 FEBRUARY 2017:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Photoshop (6 weeks)</strong></p>
<p>If you are unsure which class would suit you, please do not hesitate to contact me. Quickest way is by text to 07939 221771.&nbsp; If you have missed the September start, but would like to join a class, get in touch, as with a few private lessons, I can get you up to speed to join one of the classes.</p>
<p>To enrol for any of these courses, please phone 01235 555585 or visit www.abingdon-witney.ac.uk and select Part time courses</p>
<p><strong>PRIVATE TUITION:</strong></p>
<p>I also offer private tuition and mentoring at very reasonable rates  to people who are unable to attend evening classes. This could be just a  few sessions to learn how to get the best from a new camera, or a  longer commitment. Please telephone or email to discuss individual  requirements.</p></div>   <div id="images">
